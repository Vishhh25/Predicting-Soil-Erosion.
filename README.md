## ⚙️ Installation
To set up your environment, install the dependencies:
```sh
pip install torch torchvision numpy rasterio tqdm wandb cloudpathlib osgeo
```

## 🚀 Usage

### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
Download and preprocess satellite images using:
```sh
python magic.py create_record my_file_name
```

### 2️⃣ Model Training
Train the CNN model with:
```sh
python train.py run_the_show records
```

### 3️⃣ Jupyter Notebook Execution
Alternatively, use **Jupyter Notebooks** for interactive execution:
```sh
jupyter notebook train.ipynb
```

## 🏗️ Model Architecture
The model includes:
✅ **Three convolutional layers** (ReLU activation + Max pooling)
✅ **Global average pooling layer**
✅ **Fully connected output layer**

## 📊 Results & Tracking
Performance is tracked using **Weights & Biases (wandb)**. Model checkpoints are stored in the **models/** directory for future use.
